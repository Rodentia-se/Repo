REGISTER_HL=Register to the Main Tournament
REGISTER_MAIN=Below is the registration form. Registering is required for participating, but you are not considered a participant until we have received your payment. The participation fee is {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_SEK#} ({#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_EUR#}, {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_USD#} or {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_GBP#}). The participation fee includes {$g_iNoOfSweIncEntries} entries (four for foreign players), and during the qualifications another nine entries (eight for foreign players) can be bought. You will get a link to the payment page after registration is completed, as well. The prices are the same as last year, but due to currency exchange rates fluctuations, we've been forced to raise the USD prices.
REGISTER_VER=Please note that this is just a verification page, the registration has NOT been made yet.
REGISTER_PLAYER_REGISTERED=You are now registred. A list of all registered players is available under "Register" on the menu.<br />To pay the entrance fee, go <a href='entranceFee.php'>here</a>.
REGISTER_SPLIT_HL=Register to the Split Flipper Tournament
REGISTER_SPLIT_MAIN=Below is the registration form. Registering is required for participating, but your team is not considered a participating team until we have received your <a href='entranceFee.php'>payment</a>. The participation fee is {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_SEK#} ({#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_EUR#}, {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_USD#} or {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_GBP#} per person (i.e. not per team). This does not include any entries, but you can buy entries during the qualifications (maximum {$g_iMaxEntries} entries per team). You will get a link to the payment page after registration is completed, as well.<br /><br />Please, make sure that both players in the team are <a href="register.php">registered</a> as participants, before registering the team. If you or your partner isn't registered, you/he/she/it won't be selectable below.<br /> <br /><b>NOTE:</b> Due to the nature of the <a href='qualDetails.php'>qualification system</a>, it is possible to register more than one team per player. However, we would appreciate if you register only one team per player for now. Any given player can be a member of one ACTIVE team only. Registering more than one team per player consequently makes no sense. Read more details about this on the <a href='qualDetails.php'>qualifications</a> page.

STPB_HL=Stockholm Pinball
STPB_MAIN=Stockholm Pinball is the organizer of the Stockholm Open pinball tournament and the Stockholm Pinball Party. Stockholm Pinball is a non-profit organization that organizes the pinheads of Stockholm and the surrounding area.<br /><br />Stockholm Pinball (STPB) is a pinball association that was founded by some members of the <a href='http://www.svenskaflippersallskapet.com'>Swedish Pinball Society</a> during the spring of 2003. The idea was to give pinball enthusiasts in Stockholm opportunities to meet and participate in pinball competitions throughout the city.<br /><br />Stockholm is probably one of the cities in the world with the most pinball machines per capita, so there was a lot of interest in the association from the very first beginning. In less than two years, about 400 members have played more than 12,000 pinball matches arranged by Stockholm Pinball.<br /><br />Apart from the monthly competitions, were the members compete of the title "Stockholm's player of the month", the association also arranges pub nights and special competitions several times each year. The latest competition is PBA, "PinbAllsvenskan", where two-player teams play each other in a tournament that lasts for almost six months. The name "PinbAllsvenskan" is derived from the name of the top Swedish soccer division "Allsvenskan".<br /><br />Stockholm Pinball has also developed a system in which its members can challenge each other in head-to-head games at any time, and register the results on the STPB webpage. All these spontaneously arranged games, as well as the other competitions arranged by STPB, are connected to a ranking system. This ranking system, built on the well-known ELO-ranking model, helps to make pinball playing even more fun than it already is.<br /><br />In the beginning, STPB was only meant for Stockholm residents. But as the competitions and other arrangements have grown in popularity, STPB is now open for anyone who wishes to join.<br /><br />Each year, in connection to the founding date in March, STPB arranges a big party, the Stockholm Pinball Party, as well as the Stockholm Open tournament. As the name suggests, the tournament, as well as the party, is open to everyone. We also challenge other Swedish cities in "City Battles" from time to time.<br /><br />You are very welcome to visit <a href='http://stockholmpinball.com'>Stockholm Pinball</a>, but note that most pages are in Swedish.

OVERVIEW_HL=Overview
OVERVIEW_MAIN=The Stockholm Open is an international pinball tournament. Anyone is welcome to register for the <a href='register.php'>Main Tournament</a> and/or the <a href='register.php?sDivision=S'>Split Flipper Tournament</a> and participate in the event, as long as they <a href="entranceFee.php">pay</a> the tournament entrance fee. Friends, relatives, press, general audience and other people not participating in the tournament are welcome to enter the premises to watch the tournament free of charge. Leisure/training coin operated pinballs will be available.<h3>Schedule</h3><i class='small'>This is the preliminary schedule for the Stockholm Open 2007 tournament. Please note that some minor changes may be done.</i><h4>Friday, 6th of April</h4><b>12.00 - 01.00</b><br />Qualifications (all tournaments).<h4>Saturday, 7th of April</h4><b>10.00 - 19.00</b><br />Classics and Mini-Tournaments Qualifications<br /><b>10.00 - 01.00</b><br />Main Tournament and Split Flipper Qualifications<br /><b>20.00 - 23.00</b><br />Classics and Mini-Tournament Finals<h4>Sunday, 8th of April</h4><b>10.00 - 12.00</b><br />Split Flipper Qualifications (last entry buy: 11.30)<br /><b>10.00 - 13.00</b><br />Main Tournament Qualifications (last entry buy: 12.00)<br /><b>13.00 - 16.00</b><br />Split Flipper Finals<br /><b>16.00 - 22.00</b><br />Main Tournament Finals<br /><b>22.30</b><br />Awards Ceremony<br /><b>01.00</b><br />Closing time<h3>Qualifications: Main Tournament and Split Flipper Tournament</h3>The <a href='qualDetails.php'>qualification rounds</a> (for both the Main Tournament and the Split Flipper Tournament) will begin on Friday noon, April 6th, continue on Saturday, April 7th, 10.00 - 01.00, and finally Sunday morning, April 8th, starting at 10.00. The qualifications end time somewhat depends on the final number of participants, but our estimation is that the qualifications will end around 13.00 on Sunday, April 8th. No more entries can be bought after 12.00. They will be followed by the split flipper finals, and then the main finals. The participants may choose to play their qualification entries at anytime during the qualifications. I.e. a player/team can choose not to play on Friday, April 6th, and even not to arrive in Stockholm until Sunday morning, April 8th. Playing as early as possible is though an advantage, since you can adapt your decisions to your results, and you'll have the time to play more qualification entries. Read more about the qualification system <a href='qualDetails.php'>here</a><h3>Finals, Main Tournament</h3>The main tournament finals will be played on Sunday evening, April 8th, and the match system is a cup system where players play head to head, best out of three games. Depending on the placings in the qualifications, players enter the cup ladder in different stages. The cup system can be viewed in detail <a href='finalsDetails.php'>here</a>.<h3>Finals, Split Flipper</h3>The split flipper finals will be played on Sunday afternoon. The 8 best teams in the qualifications will advance to a straightforward head-to-head cup system, playing matches in best out of three. Read more about the finals <a href='finalsDetails.php'>here</a>.<h3>Classics Tournament</h3>The qualifications will start on Friday noon, April 6th, and the finals will be played on Saturday evening, April 7th, at 20.00. Read more about the Classics Tournament <a href='classics.php'>here</a>.<h3>General Rules</h3>General rules applying throughout the tournament can be found <a href="rules.php">here</a>.<h3>Mini-Tournaments</h3>During the tournament there will be a couple of mini-tournaments for those not playing in the main tournament(s) at the moment. These are open to everyone, and not only to the participants in the main tournament. Very stylish prizes will be awarded to the winners! The mini-tournaments are:<br /><br /><i class='small'>Yet to be determined...</i><h3>Prizes</h3>The prizes in the tournament are still being kept secret, but will be announced shortly. However, we do already know that there will be excellent prizes for the winners and runners-up, as well as for the winners of the mini-tournaments. There will also be a prize for the best female participant and a special fair-play prize. First prize in the Main Tournament will be a pinball journey across the Atlantic Ocean, as traditional.<h3>Training</h3>Some of the tournament machines might be located somewhere in the Stockholm area already today. Some might even be located on site or elsewhere in the KTH area. If you are looking for games for training purposes, <a href="http://stockholm.pinball.org">Stockholm Pinball Locator</a> is a useful tool. During the tournament, there will also be training machines available on site. The machines that will be on the premises are listed <a href="games.php">here</a>.<br /><br />

GENERAL_RULES_HL=General rules for the Stockholm Open
GENERAL_RULES_MAIN=<i class="small">This document may be changed without notice. Much credit for parts of the rules and the tournament system goes to the <a href="http://www.papa.org">PAPA</a> team for developing and writing them, and for permitting us to adopt them.</i><h3>The Nature of Pinball</h3>The unique charm of pinball lies, in large part, in the physical nature of the game. Unfortunately, this means that unusual events and outright malfunctions cannot be prevented. Nor can they all be perfectly compensated for. The Stockholm Open Organizing Committee attempts to strike a balance between compensating for malfunctions and accepting the physical nature of the game.<h3>Equipment malfunctions</h3>When a machine malfunction appears, tournament officials shall be called for ASAP.<h4>1) Minor Malfunctions</h4>A minor malfunction is any incident without external cause which deviates from the normal course of gameplay, without directly causing a player's loss of turn and without providing any player a significant advantage over others. A minor malfunction is considered part of normal play. Tournament officials shall determine what constitutes a significant advantage; in the event that such an advantage is obtained; refer to "Beneficial Malfunctions".<br /><br />Examples of minor malfunctions include:<ul><li>One hit was not registered.</li><li>The ball is stuck during a timed mode and isn't released until the timer has run out.</li><li>A ball is lost in an unnatural fashion during multiball play (i.e. no compensating for major malfunctions during multiballs).</li></ul><h4>2) Major Malfunctions</h4>A major malfunction is a gameplay problem with a machine that results in the premature loss of ball in play in a fashion that is not a normal feature of the machine's gameplay. After addressing a score-keeper or a tournament official, the player will most likely be compensated. If the official(s) agree that the incident is a major malfunction, the player will be provided with one additional ball of play at the beginning of a new game, after the current game has been completed. The one-ball score is added to the player's original score. In the event that two or more major malfunctions take place during the same game, the player(s)' game(s) will be terminated and replayed. The terminated scores will be temporarily recorded, and except in any case where the original score was unfairly improved by the malfunction, the higher score for each player will be recorded as his or her official score.<br /><br />Examples of major malfunctions include:<ul><li>A lit kickback fails to return the ball to play, ending the player's turn. This does not apply to other ball saving devices such as timed ball savers, ball traps, gates, or "virtual" kickbacks.</li><li>The machine loses track of how many balls are in the drain trough and starts bonus count.</li><li>A scoop kickout throws the ball SDTM, thus ending the players turn.</li><li>The ball falls of a habitrail and drains.</li></ul><h4>3) Catastrophic Malfunctions</h4>A catastrophic malfunction is any event not purposely or inadvertently caused by a player, which immediately ends play for all players on the particular machine. When a catastrophic malfunction occurs, the scores of the terminated games will be temporarily recorded if possible, any player(s) whose game(s) was/were not already completed must replay their game(s) from scratch. The higher score for each player will be recorded as that player's official score.<br /><br />Examples of catastrophic malfunctions include:<ul><li>The game system crashes and/or resets due to a software error or component failure.</li><li>Power is lost or interrupted.</li><li>A new game starts.</li><li>A major malfunction repeatedly recurs in spite of best attempts to repair the machine.</li></ul><h4>4) Beneficial Malfunctions</h4>Any malfunction which provides at least one player with a significant advantage over any other player competing on that machine is known as a beneficial malfunction. Tournament officials shall determine what constitutes a significant advantage. Any beneficial malfunction which results in a player being able to continue play of a ball that normally should have ended is normally allowed once per game. Examples would include an unexpected software ball save, a ball that bounces back into play without player action, or a ball that comes to rest on an unlit kickback in the outlane. Any situation which provides benefit to one or more players over any other players should be brought to the attention of the scorekeeper promptly, who will alert tournament officials. Any player who intentionally takes advantage of a significant beneficial malfunction may be given a warning and/or have his or her affected entry disqualified by tournament officials.<h3>Stuck Balls</h3>During the course of play, it is possible for one or more balls to become stuck on the playfield. If this happens during single ball play, the player must wait for automatic ball searches to occur. The expiration of any timed feature during this period is not considered a malfunction.<br /><br />If the stuck ball has not been freed after three such searches, or if the machine is not performing searches for some reason, the player must alert the scorekeeper, and a tournament official will be brought to the machine. The player must remain alert and at the machine, as he or she is responsible for the ball if it becomes freed at any point. A tournament official may initially choose to try to free the stuck ball through judicious nudging, tapping, etc. The player must remain ready to resume play at the machine during this attempt. If actions by the official result in a Tilt, this will be treated as a major malfunction (not the fault of the player). If the official frees the ball but the player does not successfully continue play, this is normal play (the fault of the player). Loss of Tilt warnings due to tournament official nudging is considered normal play.<br /><br />If the tournament official is unable to free the stuck ball or chooses not to try, the machine will be opened, and the stuck ball freed and placed either in the plunger lane, if it is manually controlled, or on the upraised right flipper, with the flipper button held by the player (if this is possible). If more than one ball is stuck, all freed balls will be placed on the right flipper before play resumes.<br /><br />If the ball is inadvertently freed while the machine is open and drains without the player regaining complete control (stopped on a flipper), this will be treated as a major malfunction. If the ball is freed and the machine closed without the player's loss of ball, play continues as normal. If the game is in multiball play and one or more balls are lost as a result of freeing stuck balls, possibly ending multiball but not ending the ball in play, this will be considered normal play.<br /><br />If a ball becomes stuck during a multiball mode, the player should attempt to trap the other ball(s) in play and request assistance. A stuck ball during multiball often represents a significant beneficial malfunction, and intentionally taking advantage may result in a penalty. Please note specifically that a ball ending up in the plunger lane during multiball on a machine where there is no autoplunger counts as a stuck ball. See "Beneficial Malfunctions" for further details.<br /><br />Any player who chooses to shake or bump the machine in order to free a stuck ball does so at his or her own risk. No allowance will be made for a player who tilts while attempting to free a stuck ball, whether or not tournament officials are present.<h3>Player Errors</h3>A player error is any player action, purposeful or accidental, which affects the normal play or outcome of a game in progress. Players conducting player errors may be warned by tournament officials. A player receiving his or her second warning is disqualified for the rest of the tournament.<br /><br />Any player who tilts his or her ball in play will not receive any penalty other than the normal loss of ball.<br /><br />Any player who tilts the ball of another player, either through interference or by tilting his or her ball so roughly that the next player's ball is affected before play continues, will receive a score of zero for that game, unless tournament officials grant an exception based on the behavior of the machine in question. The affected player(s) will be compensated as in case of a major malfunction.<br /><br />Any player who slam tilts a machine, thereby ending play for all players, will receive a score of zero for that game. The slam tilt is treated as a catastrophic failure for any other player(s) who have not completed their game(s) in progress; they will be allowed to replay a new game and choose the higher score. If a tournament official rules that the slam tilt sensor is not functioning properly, the slam tilt will be treated as a catastrophic failure for all players.<br /><br />Any player who deliberately interferes with the play of another player, through distraction, touching the machine or player, or disrupting tournament procedures, will receive a score of zero for the game and a warning.<br /><br />Any non-player, or tournament participant not playing in the game in progress, who deliberately interferes with the play of any tournament game, will be given one warning. On the second offense, the offender will be ejected from the facility.<br /><br />Accidental interference is regrettable but can happen. Any player or non-player who accidentally interferes with the play of any tournament game may be warned. If the interference was sufficient to cause the loss of ball, this will be treated as a major malfunction. If the interference terminated play for all players (for example, tripping over a power cord and pulling it from the wall), this will be treated as a catastrophic malfunction.<br /><br />A player who plays out of turn in a multiplayer game will receive a score of zero. The affected player may choose to take over the ball in play, if possible, or they may choose to have the incident treated as a major malfunction. In the event the player takes over, he or she shall be deemed "in control" after declaring his or her intent, taking his or her position at the table, and making contact with the ball via the flippers. The affected player may not change his or her mind once he or she is "in control". Any player who plays out of turn deliberately in order to employ this rule will be ejected from the tournament.<br /><br />Because the tournament consists solely of singles play, coaching of any player during a game, in any round, is not allowed. If a player specifically requests advice on a game feature during play, his or her question may be addressed only by a tournament official, and answered only in terms of whether or not the machine is functioning correctly. Players are not to seek assistance from other players or spectators. Outside of play, players are of course free to discuss features and strategies as much as they like.<br /><br />Tournament officials will be the sole determiners of what constitutes interference and whether or not it is accidental or deliberate.<h3>Player conduct</h3>All players and spectators are expected to conduct themselves in a polite and sensitive manner. Failing to do so may result in a warning from tournament officials. At the second warning the player is disqualified. The spectator is shown off the premises after the second warning.<br /><br />Smoking is not allowed in the competition area (i.e. near the players). Other smoking prohibitions may apply in the premises.<br /><br />Tilt sensors are employed to determine what constitutes unduly rough handling of each machine, within the parameters of normal play. Abusive handling such as punching, kicking, lifting, tipping, or rocking a machine, or hitting the glass in any way, is grounds for a warning and possible disqualification of game or ejection from the tournament, at the discretion of tournament officials.<br /><br />Techniques known as "Death Saves" and "Bangbacks" are sometimes practiced by certain advanced players. Because the effectiveness of these techniques varies from machine to machine, and because of the risk of injury to either player or machine, these are banned from tournament play. In the event that a drained ball bounces back into play without deliberate or significant player action, the ball may be played. This may require a ruling from tournament officials if there appears to be abusive force employed by the player.<h3>Machine breakdown</h3>If a machine breaks down during game play, all affected players will be allowed an immediate replay. If the replay is on the same machine, each player's two scores will be noted and the higher one will be registered. If the replay cannot be played immediately on the broken machine, two situations may occur:<br /><ul><li>During the <b>qualifications</b>: Each affected player may choose a replacement machine for his or her current entry. The chosen machine must be one available for qualification, but not one of the other two games in the player's current entry. Players may choose not to play on any replacement machine. In that case, their score from the broken down machine will be registered.</li><li>During the <b>finals</b>: Tournament officials will pick a replacement machine on which the affected players shall continue the match</li></ul>If a machine has a non-repairable breakdown during the first half of the qualification, all scores registered on that game will be deleted. A replacement machine will be chosen and the players affected will get a chance to register scores on that or any other of the qualification machines, free of charge. If a player has more than one score registered on the broken machine, he or she is allowed to the same number of replays as registered scores. The replacement scores will be registered in the same order as the entries on the broken machine. Players will be allowed to void these re-opened entries.<br /><br />If a machine has a non-repairable breakdown during the second half of the qualification, the scores registered on that machine will stand. No replacement game will be brought in. If the machine is fixed before qualification ends, it will be reinserted to the tournament.<h3>Software Settings</h3>In general, the software settings of each machine will be adjusted to best accommodate tournament play. The following settings will be employed on any machine that supports them:<ul><li>Tournament Mode</li><li>Free Play</li><li>3 Balls</li><li>Extra Balls disabled</li><li>Replays disabled</li><li>Match awards disabled</li><li>Buy-In or Continues disabled</li><li>Game Restart disabled</li><li>2 Tilt Warnings</li><li>Standard Factory Settings for Ball Savers, Difficulty, Timers, etc</li></ul>These settings may vary according to division, at the discretion of tournament officials.<h3>Rulings</h3>Rulings shall be made by tournament officials firstly and secondly by tournament officials and the Organizing Committee together. Any tournament official or member of the Organizing Committee is excluded from ruling on any play situation that directly affects his or her actual or potential standing as a player.

CLASSICS_MAIN=<b>NOTE:</b><i class='small'>The below is how the tournament was played in 2006. Some smaller changes has been applied for this year's tournament, and some more may be applied. We will announce when the 2007 Classics Tournament system and rules are final.</i><br /><br />Yes! There will be a classics tournament at Stockholm Open! The Classics Tournament will be played on electromechanical and solid state machines from before 1985. <a href="http://www.spelautomatsamlarna.se/">The Swedish Game Machine Collectors Association</a> will be organizing the classics tournament.<br /><br />The Classics Tournament is open to anyone, both main tournament participants and other visitors of Stockholm Open. No preregistration is needed, you will be registered when you achieve your first highscore on any of the machines. There will be eight machines available to players, at the price of 5 SEK for a three balls game.<h3>Rules</h3>The basic rules of Stockholm Open main tournament will also apply to the Classics Tournament. However, it will not be based on the same scoring system as the main tournament. Instead, as the name implies, the goal is to beat the current highscore of the machine.<h4>Qualifications</h4>No prerequisites, except feeding a non-occupied machine with 5 SEK, is needed to begin playing. Highscore lists will be posted, with the top five scores for each machine. If you make it into the top five, please call for scorekeeper attention. Your score will be registered, and the highscore list will be updated.<br /><br />The player with the highest score on a machine is not allowed to play on that particular machine until his highscore has been overrun by a higher score.<h4>Advancing to the finals</h4>The players with the highest score on each machine will advance to the finals.<br /><br />If a player has the highest score on more than one machine, he will advance on the machine where he also has the second best score. If he has the second best score on none, or more than one, of the involved machines, he will advance on the machine where he has the third best score. This formula is extended to all five highscore list entries of the involved machines, as needed.<br /><br />If the formula is incapable of distinguishing between two or more machines (meaning that the number of second, third, fourth and fifth best scores achieved by the player on the involved machines are the same), a machine will be determined by means of drawing.<br /><br />The machine determined by these rules will be considered as the player's ticket to the finals.<br /><br />Out of the machines above, the players with the second best score on the machines NOT chosen as the above player's ticket to the finals, will advance to the finals, assuming that they haven't already qualified on another machine. If any player has more than one of these second best scores, the same rules as above apply on him too.<br /><br />If the player with the second best score has already qualified on another machine, the player with the third best score qualifies. Of course, this extends all the way down to the fifth best score. And of course, the formula above applies as usual. If the above formula is mathematically correct, and properly implemented, it should result in eight players qualified for the finals.<h4>Finals</h4>The finals will be played head on head on randomly drawn machines in a basic cup system, including a third prize match. Except for the cup system, the rules of the Stockholm Open main tournament applies to the Classic Tournament finals too.<br /><br /><b>Schedule</b><br />The qualifications will begin on Friday noon, April 6th. They will continue until Saturday evening 19.00. There are no limits to the number of qualification games played per player, except for the prohibition of playing a game where you already have achieved the current highscore. The finals will begin at Saturday 20.00, and will continue until last man standing!<h4>Pricing</h4>The games are coin-operated, and the price is 5 SEK for a three balls qualification game. The finals are free.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.spelautomatsamlarna.se/"><img src="images/partners/sasf.gif" class='link' alt="The Swedish Game Machine Collectors Association" /><br /><img src="images/partners/sasf2.gif" class='link' alt="The Swedish Game Machine Collectors Association" /></a>

GENERAL_RULES_SPLIT_HL=Split Flipper Tournament specific qualification rules
GENERAL_RULES_SPLIT_MAIN=<i class="small"><b>NOTE: </b>This document may be changed without prior notice.</i><br /><br />All the <a href='rules.php'>general rules for the Stockholm Open</a> applies to the Split Flipper Tournament. And, these are the additional rules for the Split Flipper Tournament:<br /><br /><ul><li>The game has to be played by two players, using one flipper button/side of the machine each. The players are not allowed to change sides during a ball. However, in between the balls the players are allowed to change sides.</li><li>All modes etc. in the game has to be played by two players. Even the video modes.</li><li>Any kind of plunger, launch button (eg. NBA Basketball), gun (eg. Indiana Jones or Terminator 2) etc, can be controlled by any of the two players.</li><li>Any kind of button or other control located on the side of the machine (eg. Judge Dredd or Star Wars Episode 1), must only be controlled by the player on that side.</li></ul>

QUAL_DETAILS_HL=Details of the qualification system
QUAL_DETAILS_MAIN=<i class='small'><b>Note: </b>The general rules here applies to both the Main Tournament and the Split Flipper Tournament</i><br /><br />The qualification system at the Stockholm Open resembles the ones used at <a href='http://www.papa.org'>PAPA</a> and the <a href='http://www.flippersm.se'>Swedish Pinball Championships</a>.<h4>Entries</h4>Each player has {$g_iNoOfSweIncEntries} qualification entries included in the entrance fee (foreign residents have {$g_iNoOfForeignIncEntries} entries). Each qualification entry consists of three games on three different machines chosen by the player/team. The playing order is selected by the player/team, and players/teams will be assigned one of his or her chosen machines as soon as possible. When the game has finished, the player/team should stand waiting by the machine, until one of the scorekeepers is able to register the score. When all three games have been played, the player/team confirms that the scorekeeper has the correct scores, and the entry is registered into the computer systems. The player/team may now compile his or her next qualification entry.<h4>Additional entries, Main Tournament</h4>In addition to the {$g_iNoOfSweIncEntries} (or {$g_iNoOfForeignIncEntries}) entries included in the entrance fee, every player is entitled to buy a maximum of {$g_iAddEntriesSwe} (foreign residents: {$g_iAddEntriesForeign}) additional entries for {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRY_PRICE_SEK#} ({#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRY_PRICE_EUR#}, {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRY_PRICE_USD#}, {#MAIN_TOURNAMENT_ENTRY_PRICE_GBP#}) per entry.<h4>Additional entries, Split Flipper Tournament</h4>Every team is entitled to buy a maximum of {$g_iMaxEntries} entries for {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_SEK#}  ({#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_EUR#}, {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_USD#}, {#SPLIT_TOURNAMENT_ENTRANCE_PRICE_GBP#}) per player and entry. Note that the price is per player (i.e. not per team).<h4>Voiding entries</h4>A player/team may choose to void an entry at any time for any reason, as long as he or she hasn't yet confirmed the entry. As soon as the entry is confirmed, there's no way to void it. Voiding an entry still requires the entry fee be paid.<h4>Voiding teams</h4>A split flipper team may choose to void the entire team, making it possible for the players to form new teams. Voiding a team also effectively voids any entries played by the team. These entries will be disregarded in the qualification system.<br /><br />Any given player may be a member of one active team only. To form another team, the player's current team has to be voided first. To void a team, both players must inform the information desk about the decision. Certain circumstances (sickness, no-show, hangover) may in exceptional cases allow only one player to void a team.<br /><br />Voiding a team is final and can not be undone. However, the same players can form the same team again, but this will not result in any additional entries above the maximum of {$g_iMaxEntries} per team, the old entries played before the void will still be voided, and the team will have to pay a new entrance fee. In short, this is not a very bright idea. Forming a new team with another player will entitle this new team to buy {$g_iMaxEntries} new entries.<h4>Scoring</h4> When entered into the computer, the entries will receive points according to how good the scores on each individual machine are. The best score on each machine will receive {$iTopScore} points, and the scores below will receive a decreasing amount of scores. A table of the points received for each place can be found <a href="qualPoints.php">here</a>. During the tournament, live standings will be dynamically calculated and published on the Internet and on big screens on site. However, these standings are preliminary, and the final standings will, due to the nature of the system, not be available until all qualification rounds of the entire tournament (Main or Split Flipper) have been entered into the system.<h3>Finals, Main Tournament</h3>The {$g_iNoOfPlayersInFinals} best players, receiving the most points, will participate in the <a href='finalsDetails.php'>finals</a>.<h3>Finals, Split Flipper Tournament</h3>The {$g_iNoOfTeamsInFinals} best teams, receiving the most points, will participate in the <a href='finalsDetails.php'>finals</a>.

FINALS_DETAILS_HL=Finals
FINALS_DETAILS_MAIN=<h3>Main Tournament</h3>The {$g_iNoOfPlayersInFinals} best players after the qualification rounds have finished will advance to the finals. If several players end up on the same number of points, their second best (and then third best, etc) qualification entries will be compared to determine their place in the system. If, after comparing all their entries, they still end up on the same number of points, they will draw lots about their places.<br /><br />This year, it's a straightforward cup ladder beginning with the 1/16-finals, but the eight best players will step into the ladder in the 1/8-finals. This means only players placing 17 to 24 will play in the 1/16-finals, and the winners will meet the eight best players in the 1/8-finals. All matches are head-to-head in best out of three games. The matches will be played on three random drawn machines. The players will be advancing in a traditional cup manner, except for the eight best players waiting for the second run. At the gallows end, only two players will remain, and they will battle for the glorious victory.<br /><br /><i class='small'>The two players losing the semifinals will play one game on a random drawn machine to win the third prize. The final will begin after this 3rd prize match.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Depending on the number of participating players, we might need to revise the number of players going to the finals. If so, the system will still be the same, but the number of players entering the ladder in different phases might change.

RESULTS_2004=<h2>Results 2004</h2><br /><b>March 30th, 2004</b><br />Stockholms Öppna Mästerskap (The Stockholm Open Championships)<br /><br />On Saturday, February 28th 2004, the tournament Stockholms Öppna Mästerskap took place at Lasergame. The crème de la crème of Sweden's pinball players all attended with the mission to once and for all settle who was the ultimate champion, as well as battle for the 1st prize, a No Fear pinball machine! The pinball machines used for the tournament were mostly the same as were used for the previous evening's party, i.e. Totan, TAF, AFM, SS, IJ, I500, TZ, Dr Who, DM, CV, ToM, and WCS. All of them were set on tournament mode, without extra balls.<br /><br />The 44 players were seeded into six groups where they met each other twice. From each group, the two best players advanced to the quarterfinals. The winners of the quarterfinals advanced to the semifinals, and finally there was a grand battle for the 1st prize among the last four players. A few unexpected events from the quarterfinals: the pinball queen from Gävle, Helena (YOO) Walter, lost after failing to charm Dr Who. Svante (SVE) Ericsson managed to send Jorian (JOE) Engelbrektsson packing, even though he's attended Pinburgh with honor, but Jorian lost on Totan no less. Another fan favourite, Karl (KGB) Broström, who came in at 4th place at PAPA '98, was defeated in the quarterfinals in spite of all his super jackpots on IJ.<br /><br /><b>The scores in the semi finals:</b><br /><br /><b>Group N (semi), games CV, TZ and TAF<br /></b>Victor TFF Håkansson: 2 3 0, total 5p, 3rd place<br />Patrik PAL Bodin: 3 1 1, total 5p, 2nd place<br />Linus S P Jorenbo: 0 0 2, total 2p, 4th place<br />Mats MCR Runsten: 1 2 3, total 6p, 1st place<br /><br />In group N, TFF started off strongly and set the pace, while both S P and MCR at first got left behind in the dust. But then MCR managed to Tour the Mansion on TAF on the first ball, and upped the ante for the rest of the players. TFF failed to crawl his way back up to the top and finally ended up third.<br /><br /><br /><b>Group M (semi), games TOM, AFM and SS<br /></b>Per "APB" Holknekt: 3 1 1, total 5p, 3rd place<br />Stellan "S B" Bliomqvist: 1 0 0, total 1p, 4th place<br />Stefan "FEZ" Andersson: 2 3 2, total 7p, 1st place<br />Fredrik "F L" Lindberg: 0 2 3, total 5p, 2nd place<br /><br />The first player in Group M, Per APB Holknekt, were also #1 on ToM. The reigning Swedish Champion, Stellan "Dr Flipper" Blomqvist, was just a pale shadow of his usual self, while Stefan FEZ Andersson played like a machine. The audience fully expected a hair-raising shoot out on SS, but all the players "choked" simultaneously, and APB missed the opportunity to advance to the finals due to a failed crate shot in the duel against Fredrik L.<br /><br /><br />The battle in the finals for the 1st prize went down between Fredrik (F L) Lindberg, Mats (MCR) Runsten, Patrik (PAL) Bodin and Stefan (FEZ) Andersson and the games were Cirqus Voltaire, Attack from Mars and Twilight Zone. The players received points based on their scores, with the winner getting 3 points, and whoever ends up in last place received 0 points. It was close to midnight and the day was starting to take its toll on the remaining combatants.<br /><br /><br /><b>Results:<br /></b><br /><b>Cirqus Voltaire Score and Total<br /></b>1st Mats Runsten 3 3<br />2nd Fredrik Lindberg 2 2<br />3rd Stefan Andersson 1 1<br />4th Patrik Bodin 0 0<br /><br />The winning score was just 80M.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attack from Mars Score and Total<br /></b>1st Fredrik Lindberg 3 5<br />2nd Mats Runsten 2 5<br />3rd Stefan Andersson 1 2<br />4th Patrik Bodin 0 0<br /><br />Everybody had a mediocre start but Fredrik took a firm lead starting with his second ball, after scoring more than 20B on his first (!) Total Annihilation. MCR tried to catch up with his third ball but had to settle for 2nd place with a score of 28B. This wasn't enough to threaten Fredrik, who ended up with 45B.<br /><br /><br /><b>Twilight Zone Score and Total<br /></b>1st Fredrik Lindberg 3 8<br />2nd Stefan Andersson 2 4<br />3rd Mats Runsten 1 6<br />4th Patrik Bodin 0 0<br /><br />Fredrik had a sweet set up for the final game as it was only MCR who could challenge him for the 1st place, and only on the condition that he won and Fredrik ended up as #3 or less. But Fredrik nailed it with a LITZ on the first ball. MCR, usually on good terms with TZ, was cursed with a bad road map and failed to find anything but bumpers, and that sealed the deal.<br /><br /><br /><b>The winners were:<br /></b>1st Fredrik Lindberg<br />2nd Mats Runsten<br />3rd Stefan Andersson<br />4th Patrik Bodin<br /><br />Fredrik won a No Fear pinball machine and Mats a Game Boy Advance including Pokemon Pinball. Stefan and Patrik were handsomely rewarded with LOTR translites and a selection of other Stern products.
