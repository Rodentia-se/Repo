      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Tournament system (in short):</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        The system will assign a three hour qualification time slot to each player. Each time slot has a limited amount of players. Players will be allowed to choose time slot at registration time, confirmed when payment is received and on a first come first serve basis. One exception: Team players will not be able to choose time slots between Saturday 1300 and 1900. And of course you can't choose to play the main and the classics qualification rounds during the same time slot. Players participating in the classics finals will be able to use the margin hours later on Saturday to complete their main qualification rounds, if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Players will play two-player games on four random machines with two tries on each machine. On certain machines (with physical locks), players may choose to play two singel-player games. This is not match play - the scores will be individually compared to all other players that played the same machine. The best score on each machine for each player will count, combining the four scores in an entry in the SO/PAPA way. At least the 32 best players (probably more - we aim at 25-30%) will advance to the finals. The number will be adjusted as people register for participation, and final decision will be made after registration ends. Registration will end on Sept 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        The finals system will be head to head in a cup ladder with byes at different levels. At least two levels of byes will exist for the top qualifiers. Each match is played on three random machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general rules will basically be the same as for Stockholm Open: http://www.stockholmopen.nu/rules.php
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost will be 300 SEK (about €34) for main and 200 SEK (about €23) for classics. We will have T-shirts on sale for 100 SEK (about €12).
      </p>
      <p>
        More details about the system will be published on the web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Team tournament:</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be a primary and a secondary team tournament. The primary is for national teams only, registered by the IFPA country director for each country. The secondary is open for all other players, and team constellation is free (including across country borders) and will be registered by each team on the web site. They will be played at the same time and using the same system. A player can participate in one single team only. Team players can not choose to play their main and classics qualification rounds during Saturday 1300-1900.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format in short: Qualification play with two tries on three random machines set to four balls. Two machines with split flipper play, and one machine with one ball per player. Teams are free to choose what to play on which machines, and who plays in what position. The finals will be the same format, but head to head in a cup ladder and only one try per machine. If we will use byes or not depends on the number of teams registered, with final decision after registration ends. The cost will be 100 SEK (about €12) per player = 400 SEK (about €45) per team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Registration:</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web site will be released at https://www.europinball.org/ next week (the release will be announced here and elsewhere), with online registration available for both individual players and the free constellation teams. National teams will be registered by IFPA country directors (and not on the web site). All info about the tournament will be posted on the web site. Registration ends at Sept 6, and payment needs to be recieved by us on Sept 11 for the player or team to be eligible for participation. There is no cap on the number of players or teams - everyone that wishes to participate will be able to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need volunteers. The job is easy - our scorekeeping app is very intuitive, and reception work is also a piece of cake. Everything is in English, so you don't need language skills (other than English). You will be able to sign up for voluntary work at the web site, and it will grant you a free meal in the O'Learys restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>The venue:</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        Heron City is a combined shopping and entertainment center. There is all kinds of shopping, a grocery store, several restaurants (both fast food joints and "real" restaurants), movie theatres, arcade games and of course pinball machines inside the building. In the area there's also a bunch of other business, including the world's biggest IKEA store. The Skärholmen neighborhood (SKHLM), a 10 minutes walk away, have even more to offer, and central Stockholm is less than 20-30 minutes away by car or public transport, depending on traffic. Location: http://bit.ly/1amNXUc
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three hotels nearby. We are working with all three hotels to make a good deal, and we will also have a central Stockholm hotel option. Details will be posted on the web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        All players will have a 20% discount on anything they buy in the O'Learys restaurant. You will get your discount coupon at the reception when arriving on the premises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Game cards:</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        The training games and side tournaments will be money (not coin) operated. Games are paid for using an electronic card system. You will be able to buy game cards at the reception or in the O'Learys resturant. The same game cards can also be used on all arcade games on the premises. All tournament games are of course set on free play.
