The prizes for the European championship.

The European Championship started right after the Swedish Championship's
finals. It was a bit delayed, and the average game time increased... There
were very good players, so nobody could be sure about winning this tournament.
All matches were played in groups with 4 players. The 2 best players qualified
to the next group, the 3rd player was moved to the loosers playoff and the
4th player was out of play. The loosers playoff ended up with four players
who competed to get a place in the final. Only the winner was moved back to
get a new chance, and it happened to be me... :)   It was now still five
players left (four unbeaten players, and the winner from the loosers final).
We had to play one more match to get the three best players to a final match.
In the first group we had Mats Andersson (SWE), Christian Magnusson (SWE) and
Koste (FIN). The second group contained Erik Bengtsson (SWE) and
Joska Keunekamp (NL).
Christian Magnusson and Erik Bengtsson lost in that match, and the final
could now begin.

Without any question, Mats Andersson won the European Championship. He played
better and better, and nobody could beet him. The final was played on five
games (Johny Mnemonics, Pinball Magic, Water World, Apollo 13 and Who dunnit).
 
I didn't make any notes from the final, but I think the points were

Mats (SWE)       1     10    5     10    10    36
Koste (FIN)      5     5     10    1     5     26
Joska (NL)       10    1     1     5     1     18

Mats was very unlucky from the beginning, but he played better after
regaining into sense again... :)  Well... It's not to far away from the truth,
because he gets very mad and unstable if he plays bad. After winning the
second game he knew he could do it, and nobody could stop him from scoring
hugh points after that.
